        from the high Himalayas to the lush green foothills, from arid plateaus to shimmering glaciers, Nepal offers an incomparable array of hiking trails. If there's a better – and easier – place to trek anywhere in the world, we've yet to find it.

Many of Nepal's most celebrated treks pass through national parks or protected areas, but permits and national park fees are mostly inexpensive. Teahouses and trekking lodges are commonplace along most of the popular trails, but some routes involve camping, and many treks that pass close to internal borders can only be attempted as an organized trek arranged through an approved trekking agency.

              <h1> Sarangkot Hiking</h1>
                <p>Sarangkot Hiking trail offers you the splendid Himalayan range and a scenic view of Pokhara City. The hike is best for the ones intending to experience short hike with family, friends or kids or having the time restraint for the longer treks. The Sarangkot hill hiking can be started with the morning view of sunrise and continued hike to Naudanda but if you are not a morning person, we can start the hike early morning through Sarangkot reaching Naudanda. The hike can be pleasurably extended for two days staying overnight at Naudanda on the first day.

                    Sarangkot hill hike is a must-go lace if you are in Pokhara. Widely famous for Sunrise (which is highly recommended) and paragliding start-off spot, a short day hike to Sarangkot offers you the panoramic mountain view of Manaslu (8156m), Annapurna II (7937m) and Dhawalagiri (8167m) , Mt. Fishtail (6997m). Most of the travelers prefer to visit here at dawn to see the first rays of sun touching the mountain peaks offering the nature in its best form. Once you have seen the beauty of the sunrise over the vast Annapurna Himalayan range than you will meet your dream that you had before the hike and the magnificent Himalayans vistas inspire you and your group to come again for amazing views of Mountains, to know about Culture & Local authentic foods from the Mountain. The Sarangkot Hiking is for 2 night 3 days so our one night we will spend in a tea house.</p>
